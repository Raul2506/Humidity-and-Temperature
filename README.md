# Humidity-and-Temperature
Humidity and Temperature with Python and Arduino

The following project measures the temperature and humidity in the environment. That was made possible with the Arduino Uno microcontroller and 2 sensors: one for humidity and one for temperature. 

The sensors measure the temperature and humidity of the environment the user is in at a constant rate using Arduino Uno and C++, then the information is sent to a Python code that stores the information received and plots it into a graph.
